Sarah Kim: Hey everyone, and welcome back to Tech Tomorrow, the podcast where we explore the cutting edge of technology, innovation, and the future of how we live and work. I’m your host, Sarah Kim—and today, we’re diving into the biggest tech trends shaping 2025 and beyond.  
Jordan Lee: Thanks, Sarah! Always excited to talk about what’s coming next.  
Sarah Kim: So let’s get right into it. What would you say is the number one trend that people should be paying attention to this year?  
Jordan Lee: Without a doubt, AI integration is front and center. But what’s new in 2025 is that we’re moving beyond just using AI as a tool—it's becoming a collaborator. We’re seeing generative AI embedded in everything from design software to customer service platforms, enabling real-time co-creation between humans and machines.  
Sarah Kim: Right, and even in podcasting—I've heard AI tools that help with editing, scripting, even voice synthesis.  
Jordan Lee: Exactly. And another big one? Spatial computing. With Apple Vision Pro hitting its stride and other headsets entering the market, we’re witnessing the early stages of a real shift in how we interact with digital content—think less screen, more space.  
Sarah Kim: Yeah, I've seen demos where people are managing their email on virtual desks or pulling up giant 3D models for work. It’s wild.  
Jordan Lee: Totally. And the third trend I’d call out is sustainable tech. Everything from data centers to personal devices is under pressure to be more energy-efficient, more circular. Companies are building devices that are modular and repairable again—finally.  
Sarah Kim: It feels like the tech industry is getting a conscience, or at least being held accountable.  
Jordan Lee: There’s definitely pressure from users, governments, and investors. Green tech isn’t just a niche anymore—it’s a core business strategy.  
Sarah Kim: Before we wrap, can you give us a “dark horse” trend—something not everyone is talking about yet?  
Jordan Lee: Sure—biocomputing. It’s super early, but researchers are experimenting with using biological systems to perform computation. Think: DNA storage or even brain-computer interfaces in more functional, scalable ways.  
Sarah Kim: That’s equal parts fascinating and slightly terrifying.  
Jordan Lee: Yeah, a little sci-fi for now—but definitely worth keeping an eye on.  
Sarah Kim: Alright, that’s a wrap for today’s episode. Jordan, thank you so much for sharing your insights.  
Jordan Lee: Thanks for having me, Sarah!
